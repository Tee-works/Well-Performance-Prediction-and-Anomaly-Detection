# Well-Performance-Prediction-and-Anomaly-Detection

### Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting well production (gas, oil, and water) using machine learning and detecting anomalies in production data. The goal is to accurately forecast well performance and identify wells exhibiting unusual behavior that could indicate operational inefficiencies, equipment malfunctions, or data quality issues.

By leveraging a Random Forest model for prediction and an Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection, this project demonstrates how data science can be applied to optimize well management and improve operational decision-making in the oil and gas industry.
